- the FAT filesystem only write information in block of 512 bytes that take me to the question [[How a Filesystem Works?]] #computer_science
- so if I write an information that is 1000 bytes big in a FAT filesystem it will write that in 2 block of 512 bytes, but the total space used is 1024 so there is 24 bytes of [[Lack Space]] that frequently forensic investigators use to find remnants in suspicious or important data.
- lol what is [[Bitwise Arithmetic]]?
