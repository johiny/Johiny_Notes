## 1. you need good resources
There lots of resources of different kinds on the internet every one can help a certain type person but for me the most effectives in my experiences are the visual, interactive project oriented resources.
## 2. There a lots programming areas to study
Focus on one and first see if that one is for you because it will be a long way, so get good and confident in that one after jump to another.

One example of this is:

Web Dev ( very shorted )
HTML -> CSS -> JavaScript -> Framework
## 3. Found the best partner/ teacher for you
With this I'm no saying to found the smartest person in the world or a genius in code to teach you how to code, for learning code you don't need that, you need a person that connect with you that is fun and engaging that know how to teach to a beginner how to code and not the most advance technical skills to work in a mega tech company because know something isn't equal to know how to teach it.
- ## 4. Brand new things looks more complex that what really are
  Human has something since the cave age and that is fear to the unknow, fear to left their home, fear to leave your comfort zone.
  Do new thing are hard because is the first time you do it, always do something for the first time will be complicated and that feeling make you think that those new things are more complex that what really are, give you time, start with techniques like [[Deliberate Practice]] or [[Space Repetition]], and you will see the true.
## 5. Think in your brain like a athlete think in his body
If you think slowly and athlete don't train all day with his max capacity because this will burn him out and in the important moments when he needs to put in practice all his training he will be exhaust and the things are going to will bad  and that will destroy his career, that principle is the same with your brain if you study in a excessive manner you will be exhaust in the important moments.
for that reason is important to have a good study plan and use the amazing [[Space Repetition]] technique.
