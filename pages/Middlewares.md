- Middlewares are basically the logic that happened between the request and the response of a server, is all the functions, methods, validations, manipulations everything that you do with the data from a request until everything is ok and you send back the response.
- it works like [[Pipes]]] learn more about pipes please them seems important in [[computer_science]]!
- you can attach one middleware to another and after that one is complete to another, and you can do that chain infinitely.
- you can create a [[DTO]] in an middleware to verify data but looks like it has bad fame on the community
